# Udon Network Sync (Split Edition)

This folder is a split and reorganized version of `udon_network.md` for step-by-step learning. It prioritizes quick access to the minimum information needed for implementation. The original [udon_network.md](../udon_network.md) is preserved.

## Learning order (shortest → advanced)

1. Minimum implementation (required): [01_basics_minimum.md](01_basics_minimum.md)
2. Implementation (practice): [02_implementation.md](02_implementation.md)
3. Supplement (sync options / callbacks): [03_sync_options.md](03_sync_options.md)
4. Reference (supported synced types): [04_synced_types.md](04_synced_types.md)
5. Optimization (design tips): [05_design_tips.md](05_design_tips.md)

## Shortcuts by purpose

- Build something that just works: [01_basics_minimum.md](01_basics_minimum.md)
- Use ownership transfer or sync hooks: [02_implementation.md](02_implementation.md)
- Check interpolation or `FieldChangeCallback`: [03_sync_options.md](03_sync_options.md)
- View supported synced types: [04_synced_types.md](04_synced_types.md)
- Reduce sync load: [05_design_tips.md](05_design_tips.md)
